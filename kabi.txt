My best friend and I have been studying in the same school since kindergarten. We have been classmates each year at 
school. We share a very close bond and have a special friendship that we cherish and treasure. My friend is my 
partner, sitting beside me in class. She is kindly and helpful, and if I have any difficulties in understanding any 
topic in my studies, or in completing my homework or school project, she helps me. She is brilliant in mathematics 
and the sciences, while I am good at English. So we both help each other in whatever way possible. She helps me 
without ever belittling me. I greatly appreciate the quality in her. She does not make me feel obliged
